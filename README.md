 Description: The Pomodoro Time Management program consists of a GUI with interactive buttons and a dynamic countdown clock.
 The timer will start with a 25-minute study interval and stop. The next "start" button click will be a 5-minute break. After
 4 completed study intervals with breaks at the appropriate times, a 15 minute break will start upon clicking "start."
